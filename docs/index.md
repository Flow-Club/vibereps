## How It Works

```
You: "Hey Claude, refactor this code"
    ↓
🏋️ Exercise tracker launches (5 squats)
    ↓
You exercise  ←→  Claude processes your request
    ↓
Exercise complete → "⏳ Waiting for Claude..."
    ↓
Claude finishes → App shows "Ready!"
    ↓
You return to check the response
```

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flow-Club/vibereps/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the **menubar app** (recommended). For browser-only mode, add `--webapp`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flow-Club/vibereps/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --webapp
```

Then restart Claude Code and run **`/vibereps`** to choose your exercises.
